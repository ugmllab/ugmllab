# Hi there, I'm UGMLLAB 👋🌟

## About Me 📖
- 🌱 I'm actively crafting 🛠️ machine learning tools that bolster the Uyghur language 📚 and expand its reach in the digital world 🌐.
- 🤖 AI enthusiast, open-source advocate, and a champion for linguistic diversity 🌍.
- 📍 From Ürümqi to Shanghai 🏙️, at the crossroads of cultures and innovation 💡.

## Ongoing Project Highlights 🚀
- 🗣 **Uyghur-TTS**: Elevating communication with a text-to-speech system 🗣️ tailored for the Uyghur language 📝. This project is powered by Burn 🔥, the Rust-based deep learning framework, and has achieved significant milestones in performance and efficiency 🚀. Completed stages include:
  1. **Data Processing**: Successfully handled and organized linguistic data for optimal input.
  2. **Feature Processing**: Effectively extracted and refined speech features using advanced techniques.
  3. **Voice Processing**: Implemented state-of-the-art methods for processing and synthesizing voices.
  
  Currently working on the final phase:
  4. **Model Building**: In progress - constructing a robust, efficient machine learning model using Burn.


## Technologies & Languages 🛠️
- 🧠 **ML Frameworks**: A maestro in PyTorch 🔥 and a wizard in Burn 🪄, the Rust-based deep learning framework.
- 💻 **Languages**: Commanding Python 🐍 and Rust 🦀, focusing on leveraging Python for ML brilliance 🌌 and Rust for system performance and safety 🔒.

## Let's Collaborate 🤝
- 👓 Seeking collaborations in projects that empower language preservation 📖 and enhance AI tools' accessibility 🌐.
